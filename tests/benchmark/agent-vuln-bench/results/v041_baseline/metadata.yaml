# Improvement targets for v0.5.0
improvement_targets:
  overall_recall: 0.80  # Target 80%+
  set_a_recall: 0.90    # Should detect all injection/RCE
  set_b_recall: 0.90    # MCP patterns
  set_c_recall: 0.70    # Credentials
  taint_accuracy: 0.30  # Initial taint tracking

# Notes
notes:
  - "KNOWN-005 shell injection detected correctly (3 findings)"
  - "eval/exec detection limited to @tool context"
  - "MCP config detection works for embedded configs, not isolated JSON files"
  - "Credential detection needs pattern expansion"
  - "Benchmark samples may need adjustment to match tool capabilities"
